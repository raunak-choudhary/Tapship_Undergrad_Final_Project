The Agriculture sector is one of the most important sectors of our country. Recently, there are some
developments done in this field like developing the transporting and tracking management systems with
the help of greedy like algorithms and resource augmentation analysis which is one of the useful algorithmic
analysis techniques, but till date there is no efficient effort has been made in this area to solve the problem.
There is a strong requirement for a one-stop solution for this problem. [2]
There are many problems that farmers face during transportation of their crops. Like, not getting the correct
price or getting conned in agriculture market, no proper communication between the transport delivery
person and the farmer, etc. There has been various application made to solve the problem but they were not
very efficient. Due to this COVID-19 pandemic, condition of farmers has got more worse in agriculture
market. We know that Food supply chains connect heavily dependent producers and consumers throughout
the globe, often with just-in-time delivery. Many of these critical supply chains have been disrupted, or are
threatened to be disrupted, by the COVID-19 pandemic. [5]
There are several nuances of India’s agriculture and marketing system that bear on farmers’ choice of
market channels and producer prices. First, Indian agriculture is dominated by smallholders, mostly
engaged in subsistence production. Accessing transportation and communication networks involves fixed
costs and this discourages smallholder farmers from participating in remunerative markets that are often
located at a distance from the farm-gate. Second, farmer-trader relations in informal settings are often based
on mutual trust, and generally involve tied transactions involving credit, input, and output markets. Such
tied transactions influence choice of market channels, and hence the producer prices. Third, India’s
agricultural price policy provides for procurement of some commodities at the government-set minimum
support prices (MSP); intended to create incentives for farmers to adopt yield-enhancing technologies and
agronomic practices. The benefits of MSP, however, are directly proportional to the marketed surplus, and
thus it benefits larger farmers more. [6] But, the smallholder farmers because of the poor transport and
communication networks or alternatively higher cost of accessing transportation and information are more
dependent on informal channels, comprising local traders and input dealers for sale of their produce, and
receive prices significantly below MSP. Further, those selling in the regulated markets also receive prices
lower than MSP. Larger and better-informed farmers sell most of their produce to government agencies and
licensed traders in the regulated markets at better price terms. The econometric results show both
transportation and information are associated with better price realization by the farmers, with the effect of
information on producer prices being comparatively strong. Access to roads itself when combined with
reduction in asymmetry in information between buyers and sellers has the biggest impact.
In Present, Indian farmers faces many challenges. We know that, the Technological innovation and
competition have forced farmers to adopt supply chain mode to manage their supply, production and sale.
Hence, there is a requirement of an Agriculture Product Supply Chain. An Agriculture Product Supply
Chain is the system of organizations, people, technology, activities, information and resources involved in
moving agricultures product from supplier to customer. [4] One more big challenge for farmers is that to
get a good profit for the efforts and investment that they had put in. There exist different reasons like season
limitation, crop life due to which farmer get very limited amount of time to study and get profit for the
efforts they had put. We know that it is not feasible to reach all merchant/consumers physically for farmers
as it consumes much time and efforts wherein our farmers have limited amount of time. Also, traditionally,
methodologies implemented by farmer created limited access to client/consumers (merchants) enabling less
options to sell the crop product in the market. So, by introducing a new marketing method (application)
wherein farmer can sell his crop or product at each layer of marketing chain (consumers, markets or directly
to end user) with having option to set the minimum price by his own choice[3].

The issues we discussed that are associated with farmers and selling their crops in agriculture market are
not good for the farmers of our country. Hence, we as a team started thinking of an innovative idea/solution
for this problem. After discussion we came to conclusion that we should introduce five modules in
agriculture product supply chain information sharing system. The Modules are Portal Website, Order
Management Subsystem, Transportation Management Subsystem, Warehouse Management Subsystem and
Interface System. All of the Subsystems and the Database Management System are integrated in the
information sharing system.
The basic idea is that both Farmers and consumers login to the application and search for their needs.
Farmers can sell their crops by entering the details of the product, and the location details of the farmer
who sells their product. Consumers can search for the crop and they get farmers who will be available. Our
application helps to connect farmers and consumers. Both customers and farmers get more benefits through
our application. The prediction analyses of our app predict with the help of price detail of crop for farmers
of the previous year. Also, farmers get different options to sell their products in their locations that reduce
transportation costs. In India, most of the farmers are coming from a backward community and with low
literacy. Multiple languages support and the user-friendly nature of our application make it more useful for
farmers. [1]
In our application, we will make use of Time Series data which is experimental data taken at different points
in time (usually evenly spaced, like once a day). It just because a series of events have a time element that
does not automatically make it a time series, such as crop prices in a particular date, which randomly spaced
and not a time series. This data converts to time series by using point process. Our model predicts the
probability of a crop that has the highest price based on the previous year dataset. Forecasting is a process
of making predictions of the future based on past and present data. The common method of Prediction is
the ARIMA model, which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. [1]
