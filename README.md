# Tapship – Tap to Ship

**Tapship** is a full-stack web-based agriculture and logistics platform developed as the final year engineering project by a team of Computer Science students at SMVITM (VTU). The platform aims to empower Indian farmers by providing an e-marketplace (e-mandi) that directly connects them with customers and transport providers, removing middlemen and ensuring fair pricing and efficient delivery.

## 🌾 Project Summary

- **Domain**: Agriculture & Transportation
- **Goal**: Eliminate middlemen, reduce crop wastage, and improve profits for farmers
- **Core Features**:
  - Farmers can list crops, set prices, and accept bids
  - Customers can browse, bid, and arrange transportation
  - Drivers can find nearby delivery jobs and bid for transport tasks
  - OTP verification, SQL injection protection, and URL obfuscation implemented for platform security
  - Real-time crop price analytics (MEP), weather forecasts, and help zones included

## 🧠 Motivation

The project was inspired by the ongoing challenges in the Indian agricultural marketing system—namely the exploitation by intermediaries, price unpredictability, and lack of logistic support. Tapship offers a unified solution where farmers, customers, and truck drivers interact transparently and efficiently.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: PHP, Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server Tools**: XAMPP, GitHub, phpMyAdmin
- **APIs**: Bing Maps API (for live location), OpenWeatherMap (forecast), Twilio (OTP)

## 🛡️ Key Security Features

- SQL Injection Prevention via input sanitization
- URL Encoding for route protection
- Two-Factor Authentication (OTP-based) for secure login

## 🤖 ML & Recommendation Logic

- Python-based scripts recommend:
  - Crops to customers (based on location and crop history)
  - Shipment jobs to truck drivers (based on live location and shipment availability)

## 📈 Impact

- Designed to help **marginal farmers** get fair prices
- Supports **digitally illiterate users** through Panchayat-level KIOSK centers
- Built-in knowledge zone and help centers for ongoing support
- Scalable to other logistics problems beyond agriculture

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate a **crop prediction model** based on weather and soil data
- Add a **chatbot** to handle user queries in multiple languages
- Implement a **third-party payment gateway**
- Enable **quality testing modules** for crop authenticity
